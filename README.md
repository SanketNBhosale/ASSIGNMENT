# ASSIGNMENT

1 : Hand Detection for Safety in Machine Operation

this project contains 4 files as Main.py,MASK_RCNN.py,IP_CAMERA_BUFFERELESS.py and MAIN.xml
  1.MAIN.xml: for run this project properly you have to change only this file as per your system configuration
  2.MAIN.py : this file contains a algorithm for checking defect ,you have to run only this file for running project
  3.MASK_RCNN.py : This is helper class for load  and inferencing the images using detectron model
  4:IP_CAMERA_BUFFERELESS.py : This is helper class which independentely run in thread and update only latest image in its    
    class variable frame and caller of object can access that frame at runtime
